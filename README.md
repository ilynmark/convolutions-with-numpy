# Convolutions with NumPy

A convolution is a basic block for any architecture, hence, implementing it without any for loops is essential for saving a significant amount of computational time.

This repository contains an implementation of the `1D, 2D, 3D convolutions` using simple `NumPy` operations.

The functions can be found in the `conv_operations.ipynb`. The explanatory prints added to the functions will help to easier interpret the steps.
